Ground-truth collection strategies (10–15 minutes)

- Delayed feedback: batch-labeling pipelines, time-to-label tracking
- Sampling strategies: stratified sampling, uncertainty-based sampling
- Human-in-the-loop: label UI, annotation quality checks, inter-annotator agreement
- Weak supervision & proxies: use proxy signals where true labels are delayed

Mini task:
- Design a simple sampling plan to collect 500 labels per week for model validation.

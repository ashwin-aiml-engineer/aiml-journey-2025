Alerting & notification checklist (10 minutes)

- Threshold-based vs anomaly-based alerts
- Multi-level severity: info / warning / critical
- Routing: team-based routing and escalation policies
- Deduplication: suppress repeat alerts within window
- Actionability: each alert should suggest next steps or owner

Mini task:
- Draft two alert rules for a classifier: (1) precision drop > 5% in 24h, (2) sudden increase in requests (>2x spike).

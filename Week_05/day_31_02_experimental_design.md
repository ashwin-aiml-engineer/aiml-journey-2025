Experimental design (10–15 minutes)

Quick guide
- Between-subject (default for A/B): independent groups; simple and unbiased if randomization is correct.
- Within-subject: each user sees both variants (useful for low-variance metrics, requires random ordering and washout).
- Stratified sampling: ensure equal distribution for key covariates (region, device) to reduce variance.
- Sequential testing: monitor and allow early stopping with correction (alpha-spending or sequential methods).

Mini task
- For a web recommender, decide whether between- or within-subject makes sense and why.

Notes
- Pre-specify analysis (primary metric, direction, look windows) before running the experiment.

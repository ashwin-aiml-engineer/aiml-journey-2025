Day 32 — Model Versioning & Experiment Tracking

Run time: ~10–20 minutes per exercise (pick 1–2 for a short session)

Overview

This day covers versioning best practices and experiment tracking fundamentals (MLflow, DVC, W&B, lightweight local stubs). Files are concise 10–15 minute practice items: short theory + runnable demos or checklists.

Files created:
- `day_32_01_versioning_fundamentals.md` — versioning basics and lifecycle
- `day_32_02_experiment_tracking.md` — why tracking, metadata, artifacts
- `day_32_03_mlflow_quickstart.py` — MLflow tracking quickstart (fallback if not installed)
- `day_32_04_local_registry.py` — tiny JSON-based model registry stub
- `day_32_05_experiment_logging.py` — simple file-based experiment logger (params+metrics)
- `day_32_06_dvc_overview.md` — DVC concepts and local commands
- `day_32_07_wandb_neptune.md` — notes for W&B and Neptune quickstarts
- `day_32_08_packaging_and_flavors.md` — model packaging and flavors (ONNX, sklearn, torch)
- `day_32_09_reproducibility.md` — environment and data snapshotting checklist
- `day_32_10_exercises.md` — short exercises and capstone mini-project

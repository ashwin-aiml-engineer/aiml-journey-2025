Variance reduction techniques (10–15 minutes)

- CUPED: use pre-experiment covariates to reduce variance
- Stratification and blocking: reduce within-group variance
- Regression adjustment: control for known covariates in analysis
- Matched pairs and paired designs: pair similar users to reduce noise

Mini task
- Sketch a plan to use CUPED for your primary metric: pick a covariate and compute theta.

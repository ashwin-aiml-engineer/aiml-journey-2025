# Day 27.01 — Gradio Overview (concise)

Quick intro
- Install: `pip install gradio`
- Create interfaces with `gr.Interface` or the `Blocks` API
- Launch locally or share via `share=True` (temporary public URL)

When to use
- Fast client demos, prototyping, user testing, and lightweight UIs for stakeholders

Recommendation
- Start with `Interface` for single input-output demos, then move to `Blocks` for richer layouts.
